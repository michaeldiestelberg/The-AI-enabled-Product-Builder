# The AI-enabled Product Builder

I've been thinking a lot about what actually makes a good product. It's iteration - sitting with an idea long enough to discover what it really wants to become. The problem is, iteration has always been expensive. Exploring five directions instead of one meant five times the work. So we learned to commit early, to treat our first instinct as good enough.

AI changes that constraint. You can finally afford to wander. Draft five versions of a concept and see which one has something real in it. Build three prototypes and feel your way toward the one that actually works. Follow the tangent that used to feel irresponsible.

That's what this collection is about. Resources, tools, and workflows for product builders who want to explore more - and build something worth building. Check out the various folders in this repository for useful AI skills that work in Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini.
