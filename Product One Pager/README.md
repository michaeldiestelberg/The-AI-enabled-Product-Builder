# Product One-Pager Creation Skill

A Claude skill (compatible with ChatGPT and Gemini) that helps product managers create structured product one-pagers through guided conversation. It enables you go from idea to product one-pager in minutes, so you can get feedback on your ideas as quickly as possible and iterate even faster on them. You can start with an existing memo of your idea, or start from scratch.
